XFCE 4.10 in pkgsrc
===================

This is an attempt at updating pkgsrc's xfce package to 4.10.
It still requires lots of love.

Feel free to fork it and update into pkgsrc CVS repo once completed.

Compiling
---------

The meta package is in xfce4/xfce4.
It should pull in all required packages.

This repo doesn't include (yet) any of the xfce4-goodies.

Known issues:
-------------
- xfce4-tumbler core dumps.
- still unsure how to deal with icons.
